The SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper “Design Principles and Design Patterns.”
These concepts were later built upon by Michael Feathers, who introduced us to the SOLID acronym. And in the last 20
years, these five principles have revolutionized the world of object-oriented programming, changing the way that we
write software.
